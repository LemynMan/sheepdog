#Needs a stress level â€“ the longer the dog is within their threat radius, 
#or the threat radius overlap, the higher the stress. If the sheep are 
#stressed they will run directly awa from the threat. For higher levels, 
#if the stress gets too high then at a threshold they can attack (rams, 
#billygoats etc). For low enough stress the animal goes into grazing 
#animation and stays pretty still.
